Example
[TASK]  
Write a short adventure story about a **12-year-old student who discovers a hidden portal** in the school library.  
[CONTEXT]  
The story should be **funny and exciting**, set in a modern-day school, and narrated like a **diary entry** from the main character‚Äôs point of view.  
[REFERENCES]  
Use a **writing style similar to "Diary of a Wimpy Kid"**‚Äîcasual, humorous, and engaging. Keep paragraphs short and include dialogue.  
[EVALUATE]  
Make sure the story is **entertaining, easy to read, and has a clear beginning, middle, and end**. The main character should face a challenge, like solving a secret code to unlock the portal.  
[ITERATE]  
If the first response is too serious or lacks humor, **add more funny moments and unexpected twists**. If the story is too short, expand on the adventure inside the portal.
