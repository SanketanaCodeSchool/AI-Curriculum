28-Feb

Covered So far
- Google Gemini as the AI provider --> Backend AI Model
- Streamlit as front end --> Frontend
- Supporting: Unix, Git, Postman


Backend AI Model
	- ChatGPT OpenAI (paid)
	- Google Gemini (free)
	- other like Claude, Mistral, Deep Seek

Ways to access backend model
- Fun fact generator --> Python SDK

Front-end
- Streamlit / Gradio --> Web based front end, generated by a Python code
- Postman
- Curl
- Custom Application - TKinter
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript to create own front --> JS / Node SDK


Gemini Sandbox --> Frontend
OpenAI Sandbox --> Frontend
Google Vertex --> Frontend

System vs User prompt

Gemini Models
- What are the different models
- What can I do with them 
- What are the APIs provided by the model

OpenAI API walkthrough

Overview of Tokens

Resources
- Youtube Shorts eg: What is OpenAI o1 model, how is it different from 03
- Daily.dev --> Keep track of industry new
- deedlearning.ai --> nice short courses (Andew Ng platform)
- Fireship channel --> 100 sec videos, on all new tech

1) Building chains (eg: Langchain)
2) Using own data to answer questions
	1) RAG --> Passing own data as additional context to model
	2) Model Tuning --> Deep integrate the custom data into the model
3) Agentic AI --> Create an army of virtual bots that performs the task indenpendently and also interact with each other --> CrewAI, Langgraph


How should the Self Learning looking 
Daily - 15-20 min scrolling tech news (fireship, daily.dev, google)
Weekly - Abhinav's satsang, Read 1 whitepaper / long form video 1-hr
Monthly - Structured Learning course 3-4, eg: Deeplearning.ai, Udemy
Yearly - University course. eg: from MIT, IIM, IIIT 


Homework
- Read about TopP, Frequency Penalty, Presence Penalty
- Explore OpenAI playground, Google AI Studio
- Explore OpenAI API and run few API from Postman
